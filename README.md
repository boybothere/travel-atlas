# Creating responsive tours and travel website
Title: Creating a Responsive Tours and Travel Website using HTML, CSS, and  JavaScript
Happy to present Travel Atlasâ€”my semester web tech project for seamless travel bookings!

I've simplified everything from smooth form validations to instant booking confirmations, letting users effortlessly book, update, or cancel tours with ease.

To make it even better, I've set up an email system using Mailtrap (for demo purpose) to notify our service providers about bookings and cancellations.

To tackle the problem of instant support and increased engagement I have added a chatbot whom I call AI Roger.
Clean design, easy management, and a seamless experience awaits!
